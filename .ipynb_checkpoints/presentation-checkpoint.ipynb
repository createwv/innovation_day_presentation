    "* ## Entrepreneurship\n",
    "### *Working how, where, when you want, growing you and your communities' ideas*\n",
    "```\n",
    "Create West Virginia not only celebrates tinkerers, makers, and dreamers, we support them by engaging them in pitches, connections with partners and resources, and educate potential entrepreneurs of all ages.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##  Education\n",
    "### *Fostering natural human curiosity, collaboration, and exposure to tools*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It's not just a rapidly growing industry, if you aren't looking at the most up to date technology in your sector, you are missing out on big opportunity. Technology allows us to work smarter not harder. We can reach more people, gather more data, automate, streamline. Chances are, if you don't believe technology can solve your problems, then you haven't learned enough to make technology work for you. When the light bulb lights up, your life will never be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every study of technology is equally as important and all are overlapping. Cyber-security is extremely important as we bring access to technology to more and more people. Financial technology has had many advances with the introduction of blockchain which is applicable in more ways than just currency. Robotics and electrical engineering allows you to use technology to directly interact with our physical world—the screen is not the limit. Data science empowers us with vast amounts of knowledge once thought unattainable, and machine learning breaks down huge barriers. Web development allows us to network devices, communicate, create efficient tools. Don't be a user, be a super user and dive into tech.\n",

    "Keep a diverse portfolio. Isn't that what a good investor would tell you? That's why it's important to invest in diversity itself. That means people of different race and backgrounds, people of all different ages, people with different abilities, people with different genders and sexual orientation, people with different ideas and new perspective. These people must be connected and put into leadership for West Virginia to progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the turn of the 20th century, West Virginia was one of the most ethnically diverse places in the United States. More than a hundred languages were spoken in various regions of the state, where African Americans flocked from the South to join immigrant Italians, Hungarians, and Jews to work in the coal fields. West Virginia's Northern Panhandle was the new home of thousands of Italians and Eastern Europeans who came to build steel mills. Flemish glass specialists jump-started the state's industrial glass industry. A burgeoning chemical industry in the mid-20th century brought innovators from around the world to the Kanawha Valley, where they created enormous wealth for such companies as Union Carbide, DuPont, FMC, and other industry giants. And Charleston was once home to the largest Lebanese population outside of Lebanon, who came, it is said, because the region reminded them on their mountainous homeland in Lebonon's fertile crescent.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "These ethic groups and others still enrich the culture today, but we want more: more people who bring ideas that will reboot our towns, enliven the conversation, stimulate us to place ourselves among the most creative communities in the world. Gender, sexual orientation, philosophy, race, age, religion—we're working through all of it, keeping our cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ## Quality of Place\n",
    "Environments communities desire. Arts, entertainment, and healthy living\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a community cool?  A place where all kinds of people feel at ease, safe, stimulated to do their best work, where opportunities for creative play are as abundant as career opportunities?  One, it's the people, and two, it's the place, as envisioned and created by the people.  West Virginia has extravagant riches in outdoor recreation assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supporting the development of creative communities, companies, centers of learning that thrive in the global Innovation Economy. But more importantly, connecting them with one another.\n",
    "* Training local community leaders in innovation economy principles through conferences, workshops and community gatherings, and encouraging communities to incorporate these principles in community growth plans. \n",
    "* Developing, launching and supporting commercial and social entrepreneurship projects, businesses, and initiatives that further connect and empower creatives and entrepreneurs. \n",
    "* Reaching out globally to recruit creatives who want to build interesting lives and careers that matter in a place brimming with raw opportunity.  "
